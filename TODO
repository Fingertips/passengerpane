- When a new app is added directly open the browse panel.
- Open panel as sheet.
- Use real authorization, code: http://code.google.com/p/kismac-ng/source/browse/trunk/Subprojects/BIGeneric/BLAuthentication.h / .m
- Support RailsBaseURI and parse this from the address field.
- Support the backspace and delete keys for removing apps from the list.
- Find out how to add help text and tell Thijs to write some.
- Add a warning when you leave the pane and the changes haven't been applied (see the Network pane for an example).
- Disable the fields when multiple apps have been selected and when the apps list is empty.
- Disable the Restart button when the apps list is empty.
- Make 'http://www.modrails.com' a link.
- Wouldn't it be better to have a single global Apache configuration file instead of making it per-user?
