- Treat the <VirtualHost(.+)> as user defined data as well.
- When a application is written to disk for the first time and you start editing the apps settings directly afterwards
  the permissions directives are lost because they aren in the @user_defined_data yet. Probably better to add this as a default to @user_defined_data.
- When false is returned by executeCommand_withArgs show an alert telling the user to check his console.
- Check paths in help file.
- Check if "apachectl graceful" is causing all these permission denied errors and if "launchctl stop org.apache.httpd" would solve this.
