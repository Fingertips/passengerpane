* Add inline docs to code, or however the Nu way is for API docs
* Check what the best way is to terminate the app
* Check if it plays nice when there's already a runloop, eg in a (iOS) app runner
* Clean up specs by classes
* Clean/abstract the runloop related methods that keep the current-index and schedule the next to run etc
* Maybe make Should-not return a ShouldNot instance, so that the state of the original Should instance ins't negated? But this is mainly useful for meta-testing, like testing Bacon itself.
* Make Should-satisfy:block: use the body of the block if @object is a block?
