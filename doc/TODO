Now

- Add a button to open the current application in the default browser.
- Show a focus ring around the item list when you're about to drop a folder onto it.
- When the panel is locked, also disable the labels inside the box and not only the fields.
- Show the 'Drag a Rails or Rack application folder here' message when the item list is empty.
- Don't show 'No Selection' in the text fields.

Later

- Use the NSInvalidDataFreestandingTemplate image to indicate invalid fields.
- Add some simple functionality to check if an update is available and direct the user to the download page.
- Merge the Aliases text field into the Address field and add documentation about this to the help html file (not completely sure if this is an improvement though, let's discuss this first).
